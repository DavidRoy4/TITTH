#Take It To The House Data!

This is the GitHub repository for all of the data and codes that create the data analysis and visualization for Take It To The House. 
It is a website created by a couple of college students with a passion for sports and data analytics. Another goal was to create a 
place to share data and coding techniques those who may have similar interests. I hope you enjoy looking through the data and code, and 
good luck on any analytic endeavors!
